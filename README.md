This project creates a website that consolidates recipes I commonly use

This project is the first in the Odin curriculum that create a website
with an index (home page) that link to multiple other recipe 
pages.  It link to a Baked Penne recipe page, a Teriyaki Chicken 
recipe page, and a mexican red rice recipe page.  

Each webpage has an image, a short discription, a list of ingredients, 
and the directions for the recipes.
