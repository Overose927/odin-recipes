        <h2>Discription</h2>

        <p>
            Most of my favorite foods growing up was rice. With the uncanny
            ability to take on any flavor that was cooked with it that made it
            never boring to eat.  Amongst my favorite rice dishes is Arroz con 
            Pollo.

        <p>
            I have eaten it more than I would like to admit but it
            never gets boring with its nutty flavor and enticing aroma, it will
            be the center piece of any mexican food night.
