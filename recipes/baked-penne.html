            <li>1/2 tbsp red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 cup of your favorite red wine</li>
            <li>28 ounces of canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of dried basil</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>

            <li>1 cup of mozzerella cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li> 2 ounces of parmasean cheese</li>
                
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Heat a 5 qt dutch oven on 
                medium heat.  Brown sausage links, about 5 minutes.  
                Remove the sausages from the the dutch oven retaining the 
                fat that remains in the pan. Let the sausage links rest for 
                about 5 minutes then cut each link into 6 pieces.
            </li>

            <li>Add additional oil as needed to the heated dutch oven as 
                needed.  Add the garlic and the red pepper flake to the 
                oil and fry for 30 seconds or until aromatic.  Return the 
                sausage to the pot and saute until fully cooked, about 3 
                minutes.
            </li>
                    
            <li>
                Add the wine to the pot and reduce until the alcohol is 
                cooked off, around 3-5 minutes.  Add the can of crushed 
                tomatoes to the pot and reduce the heat to medium low heat.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bring the sauce to a simmer and stir the oregano, basil, 
                and bay leaves into the sauce.  Cover and let the sauce 
                simmer between 30 - 60 minutes. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook your pasta 
                according to the box instructions.  Cooking times vary 
                depending on the brand and makeup of the pasta.
            </li>

            <li>
                Strain off the pasta and set aside trying to time the 
                pasta to be done the same time the sauce is ready.   
            </li>

            <li>
                Once the sauce is done add salt to taste.  Then add the 
                ricotta to the sauce, making sure that the ricotta is 
                dry as any moisture can break the emulsion of the sauce.  
                If the ricotta is wet pat it dry between two sheets of 
                paper towels or wring it out in cheese cloth.   
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir the cheese into the sauce, making sure it is evenly 
                distributed in the sauce.  Add the pasta and stir to fully 
                incorporate the pasta.  
            </li>

            <li>
                Place the pasta into a casserole dish and sprinkle the 
                shredded mozzerella cheese on top cooking for 20 minutes.  
                Once done let the dish cool for 5 minutes. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Garnish with parmasean cheese as desired.  Enjoy!
